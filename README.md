# my-shiny-project
this repo is made to store my self created shiny app and the supporting documentation

the app can be run on the shiny server https://reneintveld.shinyapps.io/week_4/

with this app you can explore the contents of the trees database in R.
this database consists of the details of 31 trees, recording Girth, Height, and Volume of each tree

you can see the correlation of the 3 variables by choosing any 2 out of 3 variables.

the selected 2 variables will be plotted in a scatter plot.

with sliders you can adjust the axes of the graph to make the picture more clear.
